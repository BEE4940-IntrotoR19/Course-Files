Hello! 
I'm Erin (she/her/hers), I'm a PhD student in Biological and Environmental Engineering. I'm in my 6th (and hopefully final) year. 
My PhD research is focused on how fertilization of agricultural land impacts downstream water quality. 
I'm interested in working with farmers to come up with effective solutions that work for everyone. I have an interdisciplinary committe
with both physical and social scientists advising me. I am very rarely on campus (I live mostly in Canada right now!) so most of 
our interactions will have to be online but I am open to skype or zoom calls as well as email (egm55). 

I am very excited to be teaching Intro to R again. I taught it in person last spring and I am excited to be offering it as an online course.
Because it's a relatively new course developed by me, I am always looking for feedback on how to improve the course.
If you have any ideas, questions, concerns, comments, please don't hesitate to email me (egm55). 

Please comment on this file with a short introduction to yourself (name, preferred pronouns, department, year, 
why you're interested in learning R, anything else you'd like to add)

Thank you!
Erin

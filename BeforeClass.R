#Hey there! This script will get you started getting comfortable in R
#To execute lines of code in the script hit CTRL+Enter or CTRL+R if you have an older version
#Let's play around a bit
  #Can you: 
    #do some basic math?
          12+3
    #save a variable?
          x=6 
          y=5
  	#What's: 
        x+y 
        z=x+y

#Have you figured out the difference between the console and the script?
        
        
#What about the environment? What's that? 
        
        
#Create a new blank script and save it as "R Practice" in the folder you created for this class
#Play around to figure out how to do this, explore the toolbar at the top

#To write a comment in your script type #and then type. The text will turn green.

Hello everyone! 
Each week I will be posting a summary of what you are to complete for that week's lesson and the deadlines for each activity. 
The file will be titled "Summary of Lesson X Activities" so you can easily find the list for the current lesson. 
This file is a summary of what I would like you to complete before you start in on Lesson 1. The activities will get you oriented to the course
and the software we'll be using. Alright here's your list. You must complete all activities no later than January 25th at 11 pm. 

1.  Download R from this website to the computer that you will use for the lesson each week: http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/
2.  To that same computer, download the free version of R Studio from here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
3.  Make an account on GitHub and join the BEE4940-IntrotoR19 Organization (you should have an invite to do this in your Cmail already)
4.  Read the Introductions!! file on GitHub and introduce yourself 
5.  Download R script (.R file) titled BeforeClass.R, open it in RStudio, and follow the instructions
6.  Watch video titled XXX to get an intro to the structure of the course

I know it might seem like a long list but each of these things should take only a few minutes. If you get stuck, send me an email (egm55). 

Thanks! 
Erin
